# Siete_Y_Medio
A Spanish game similar to Black Jack, for detail explanation see "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sette_e_mezzo"


Quote from Wiki: 
"The purpose of the game is to achieve the highest score possible without busting, i.e. without exceeding 7Â½. The dealer must try to match or exceed the score of the largest possible number of players without going over. The dealer collects the amount wagered by all players who get knocked out, or who achieve a score of less than or equal to his own, and pay the equivalent of the bet players that exceed his or her score. The score of each player is calculated by adding the points of all the cards he has.

Cards from ace to 7 are worth as many points as their numeric value, with the ace equaling one point. Face cards are worth half a point. A variant includes the king of diamonds as being wild, may take the any value at the discretion of the owning player."
